# statsdproxy

A proxy for transforming, pre-aggregating and routing statsd metrics.

This is not a Sentry product, not deployed in any sort of production
environment, but a side-project done during Hackweek.

If you want a production-ready thing like this, consider using
[Vector](https://vector.dev/).
